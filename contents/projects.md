<strng>2023</strong> [Borgoaperto.it](https://borgoaperto.it/mediawiki/index.php/Pagina_principale) is my master's thesis project. The main objective of the project is to allow low cost and open source digitization of architectural heritage in Centola (SA).
It was developed under the supervision of prof. Alfonso Ippolito and co-supervision of Martina Attenni, PhD.
