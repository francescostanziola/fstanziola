I am a PhD student at Sapienza University of Rome, enrolled in the program History, Representation, and Restoration of Architecture, within the Representation curriculum.

My research focuses on the digitization of architectural cultural heritage, with particular attention to the phenomenological aspects that characterize these extraordinary testimonies of humanity's past. I primarily work with laser scanning, photogrammetry, and I am exploring the topics of neural rendering.

My other interests revolve around the graphic languages of representation and communication, surveying, and design. 

I am also passionate about electronic music and aviation.
